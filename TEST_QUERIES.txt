TESTING TIPS
============

1. Start with basic tools (echo, calculate, get_current_time)
2. Use testnet addresses and assets only
3. Generate test accounts first
4. Fund accounts with testnet faucet
5. Test tools in logical order
6. Check server logs for errors
7. Verify results with Algorand Explorer

ERROR TESTING
=============

Invalid Inputs:
- Invalid address format
- Non-existent transaction ID
- Invalid mnemonic phrase
- Negative amounts
- Non-existent asset ID

Network Errors:
- Invalid API endpoints
- Expired API tokens
- Rate limiting
- Network timeouts

PERFORMANCE TESTING
===================

Load Testing:
- Generate 10 accounts simultaneously
- Create 5 assets in parallel
- Send 20 transactions in sequence
- Search 100 transactions

Memory Testing:
- Store 50 wallets
- Load large transaction data
- Process large TEAL programs
- Handle large search results

SECURITY TESTING
================

Input Validation:
- Test with SQL injection attempts
- Test with XSS payloads
- Test with extremely long inputs
- Test with special characters

Access Control:
- Test with invalid mnemonics
- Test with wrong passwords
- Test with unauthorized addresses
- Test with restricted operations

NOTES
=====

- Replace placeholder values like [ALGORAND_ADDRESS], [MNEMONIC], etc. with actual test data
- Always use testnet for testing
- Keep test data separate from production data
- Monitor server logs during testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios
